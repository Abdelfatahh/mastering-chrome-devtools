## Interesting facts about page load time

> Walmart and Amazon both observed a 1% increase in earnings for every 100 milliseconds of improved webpage speed.
>
> Yahoo saw a 9% increase in traffic to every 400 milliseconds of webpage speed improvement.
>
> Google loses 20% of their traffic for every additional 100 milliseconds it takes for a page to load.

## The Network Waterfall

Let's talk about the life of a network request.

- ◻️ **Queueing**
  - There are higher priority requests.
  - There are already six TCP connections open for this origin, which is the limit. Applies to HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1 only.
  - The browser is briefly allocating space in the disk cache
- ⬜️ **Stalled**
  - The request is stuck Queueing
- 🟩 **DNS Lookup**
  - Resolving an IP address
- 🟧 **Initial Connection**
  - TCP handshakes or establishing SSL
- 🟧 **Service Worker Startup**
  - Starting up a Service Worker
- 🟪 **Service Worker respondsWith**
  - Service Worker sending data to browser
- 🟩 **Waiting (TTFB)**
  - Waiting for the first byte from the server
- 🟦 **Content Download**
  - Browser is receiving a response from a server
