# CPU & Memory

In this lesson we'll learn:

- How to read a flamegraph
- Find page jank
- Check your applications FPS
- Understand scripting, rendering and painting
- Find slow functions

## What is page jank?

> Jank is any stuttering, juddering or just plain halting that users see when a site or app isn't keeping up with the refresh rate.

## Understanding 60 FPS

Most devices today refresh their screens 60 times a second. The browser needs to match the deviceâ€™s refresh rate and put up 1 new picture, or frame, for each of those screen refreshes.

Each of those frames has a budget of just over 16ms (1 second / 60 = 16.66ms). In reality, however, the browser has housekeeping work to do, so all of your work needs to be completed inside 10ms.

## A little JavaScript

![layout thrashing](/layout-thrashing.png)

Enter `requestAnimationFrame()`

```javascript
function repeatOften() {
  // Do whatever
  requestAnimationFrame(repeatOften);
}
requestAnimationFrame(repeatOften);
```
