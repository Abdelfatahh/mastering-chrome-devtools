    h1 Mastering Chrome DevTools

    p This site is designed as teaching aid for my "Mastering Chrome DevTools" workshops but I hope it will stand fine on its own.

    h2 The workshop is divided into multiple sections:

    ol
      li
        a(href='/editing') Editing
        span - Changing styles and markup and persisting those changes to disk.
      li
        a(href='/debugging') Debugging
        span - Using the step-through debugger to fix a buggy program.
      li
        a(href='/profiling') Profiling
        span - Audit a slow page. Run a JavaScript CPU profile and figure out what's causing slowness.
      li
        a(href='/timing') Timing
        span - See how long each function on your sites takes and figure out which one is the longest!
      li
        a(href='/page-jank') Page Jank
        span - Try to identify page jank without tooling. Then use the DevTools to fix it!
      li
        a(href='/memory-leaks') Memory Leaks
        span - Learn about the common causes of JS memory leaks. Then find the one on the page and fix it!
