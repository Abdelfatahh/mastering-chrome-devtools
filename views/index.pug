    h1 Mastering Chrome DevTools

    p This site is designed as teaching aid for my "Mastering Chrome DevTools" workshops but I hope it will stand fine on its own.

    h2 The workshop is divided into multiple sections:

    ol
      li Editing - Changing styles and markup and persisting those changes to disk.
      li Debugging - Using the step-through debugger to fix a buggy program.
      li Profiling - Audit a slow page. Run a JavaScript CPU profile and figure out what's causing slowness.
      li Timing - See how long each function on your sites takes and figure out which one is the longest!
      li Page Jank - Try to identify page jank without tooling. Then use the DevTools to fix it!
      li Memory Leaks - Learn about the common causes of JS memory leaks. Then find the one on the page and fix it!
